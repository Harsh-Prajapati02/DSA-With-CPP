## 📂 Programs Included  

### 1️⃣ Print Numbers from 1 to N  
**Description:**  
This program takes a user input `n` and prints numbers from `1 to n` using both `for` and `while` loops.  

📄 **File:** [`print_numbers_1_to_n.cpp`](https://github.com/Harsh-Prajapati02/DSA-With-CPP/blob/main/Loop_Based_Questions/print_numbers_1_to_n.cpp)  

---

### 2️⃣ Print Only Even Numbers from N to 1  
**Description:**  
This program prints only even numbers from `n` down to `1` using loops.  

📄 **File:** [`print_even_numbers_n_to_1.cpp`](https://github.com/Harsh-Prajapati02/DSA-With-CPP/blob/main/Loop_Based_Questions/print_even_numbers_n_to_1.cpp)  

---

### 3️⃣ Print Leap Years Between 2000 to 3000  
**Description:**  
Lists all **leap years** between `2000 to 3000` using conditional statements inside a loop.  

📄 **File:** [`leap_years_2000_to_3000.cpp`](https://github.com/Harsh-Prajapati02/DSA-With-CPP/blob/main/Loop_Based_Questions/leap_years_2000_to_3000.cpp)  

---

### 4️⃣ Print Fibonacci Series Using a While Loop  
**Description:**  
Generates and prints the **Fibonacci series** using a `while` loop.  

📄 **File:** [`fibonacci_series_while_loop.cpp`](https://github.com/Harsh-Prajapati02/DSA-With-CPP/blob/main/Loop_Based_Questions/fibonacci_series_while_loop.cpp)
